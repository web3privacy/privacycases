# Italy Privacy Issues - use cases x ETHRome developers

This project aims to bridge the gap between local privacy violations—such as censorship resistance in Turkey, journalist leaks in Mexico, and safe communication within occupied territories in Ukraine—and software development at privacy hackathons.

It's part of the "social layer" activity fostering political awareness among developers so that they will tackle local & not just global issues.

### Local-specific privacy stories raised by Italians to be addressed during [ETHRome](www.ethrome.org) Hackathon:
